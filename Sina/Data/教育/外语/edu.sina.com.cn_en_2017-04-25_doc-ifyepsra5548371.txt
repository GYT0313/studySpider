　　神经退化性疾病是指大脑和脊髓的细胞失去了这些细胞应有的功能，包括做决策和控制肢体活动的能力。这些细胞不容易再生，所以此类疾病的对人们的影响是毁灭性的。科学家们希望他们已经找到了一种药物来阻止所有神经退行性脑疾病，包括阿尔茨海默病。请听  James Gallagher  的报道。　　A single drug to  all  is the . Diseases such as , ,  all lead to  proteins building up in the brain. This makes brain cells shut down their own protein production and eventually starve.　　Four years ago, Medical Research Council scientists showed for the first tie, that a drug could force the brain to keep making proteins and stay alive. But their findings were in mice and the  they used would have been  in people.　　Now after testing more than a thousand chemicals, they found two that are safe for human use and still protect the brain in animal trials. One of the drugs, Trazadone, is already used as an .　　 are planned, but the findings so far have been described as ‘exciting, important and potentially a major step forward’.　　　　cure 治愈　　neurodegenerative diseases 神经退化性疾病　　ambitious aim 雄心勃勃的目标　　Alzheimer’s 阿尔茨海默病　　Huntington’s 亨廷顿氏舞蹈症、慢性进行性舞蹈病　　Parkinson’s 帕金森氏病　　compound 化合物　　toxic 有毒的　　antidepressant 抗抑郁药　　clinical trials 临床试验　　　　　　1.
