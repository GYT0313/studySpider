　　It’s well known that if you’re going to eat chocolate, dark chocolate is the way to go. There’s lots of evidence that dark chocolate is good for you, but until pretty recently, scientists didn’t know exactly why.　　众所周知，如果要吃巧克力，黑巧克力是上佳之选。许多证据表明黑巧克力对健康有益，但直到最近科学家们才揭开此中玄机。　　Candy Hearts　　有益心脏健康　　Now there may be an answer. According to researchers at the Louisiana State College of Agriculture, dark chocolate is healthful because it feeds specific bacteria in the gut that turn it into anti?inflammatory compounds, which help keep the heart healthy.　　现在我们也许找到了答案。根据路易斯安那州立大学农学院研究人员的研究，黑巧克力之所以有益健康是因为它为肠道提供一种特别的细菌，使得黑巧克力转变成有助于心脏健康的消炎化合物。　　The scientists used a simulated digestive tract to test three cocoa powders. Cocoa powder is an ingredient in chocolate, and contains antioxidant compounds and some fiber that are hard to digest in the stomach. But when they reach the colon, the bacteria feast and turn them into anti?inflammatory substances.　　科学家使用模拟消化道来检验三种可可粉。可可粉是巧克力的配料之一，含有抗氧化剂化合物和纤维，很难在胃里消化。但是当它们到达结肠，细菌将其分解转变成消炎物质。　　Chocolate Covered　　巧克力之益　　More research is needed to confirm the findings, but the scientists think that eating dark chocolate, especially in combination with prebiotic carbohydrates found in foods such as raw garlic and cooked whole wheat, can drastically improve human health.　　该发现还需更多的研究来支持，但是科学家们认为，食用黑巧克力，特别是同生蒜和熟全麦中的益生元碳水化合物结合起来，可以大大改善人体健康。　　And combining dark chocolate with pomegranates, açai berries, and other foods high in antioxidants could prove even more healthful.　　同时，有证据表明如果能将黑巧克力和富含抗氧化剂的石榴，浆果等食物结合起来，效果更佳。　　Dark chocolate still has plenty of fat, sugar and calories, so its healthful properties do not mean you should overindulge.　　黑巧克力中含有大量脂肪，糖分和能量，因此它虽有益健康却不宜食用过量。　　But if you love chocolate and also love being healthy, dark chocolate is the way to go. And now scientists know why.　　但是如果你既爱巧克力又注意保持健康，那么黑巧克力是不二之选。而且现在又得到了科学家的证明。
