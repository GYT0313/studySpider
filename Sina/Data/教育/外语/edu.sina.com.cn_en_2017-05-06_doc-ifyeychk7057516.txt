　　夏季是英国最温暖的季节，晴天居多再加上白昼时间长，正是举办各类庆典节日和活动比赛的最佳季节。跟随《随身英语》一起来看看英国夏季一些有名的节日和户外活动。　　课文内容　　词汇: tourism 旅游　　Britain is on the go-to list for tourists worldwide but, with the value of the pound reaching historic lows after the Brexit vote, a visit has became more timely.　　The summer is a great time to be in Britain. The British Museum, the Natural History Museum, the Tate Gallery are all a must-see for everybody who comes to the country, but there's also a lot of interesting things to do for those who love the outdoors.　　The Notting Hill Carnival changes the face of the famous London borough in the last weekend of August. It's the largest street festival in Europe. First held in 1964, it's a celebration of Caribbean culture but now includes Brazilians, Africans, Europeans and anybody else who likes to dress colourfully and feels the urge to dance to the sound of a beat.　　With its popularity growing it's estimated that 50,000 performers will take part in the parade, attracting more than 1 million people over the weekend.　　Outside the capital there's also plenty to do. Early in August there's the Robin Hood Festival in Sherwood Forest Country Park, Nottinghamshire. The legendary characters of books and movies – Robin Hood and the evil Sheriff of Nottingham - can be found there amid jousting tournaments and comedy acts. For those into nature, there's always the forest to enjoy.　　In mid-August, in Bristol, a city about 200km from London, the sky is filled with colour during its annual balloon fiesta. If the weather is good, more than 100 hot air balloons rise up from the Fiesta's site in Ashton Court.　　Britain is full of traditions and sometimes just stopping at a country pub for a beer or having cream tea in a small tea room can make a moment special. Just be careful where you end up, though. Coaches full of sightseers went to the small village of Kiddlington early this month. As the visitors were taking pictures of the houses and entering private gardens, the locals were taking pictures of them. To this day, nobody knows what the tourists were doing there. Always be sure where you are, and learn enough English to ask for directions. Have a nice holiday!　　词汇表　　Brexit 英国脱离欧盟　　timely 适时的　　The British museum 大英博物馆　　must-see 必须要看的　　outdoors 户外，野外　　The Notting Hill Carnival 诺丁山狂欢节　　street festival 街头庆祝活动　　Caribbean 加勒比地区的　　urge 欲望，冲动　　popularity 受欢迎程度，人气　　Robin Hood Festival 罗宾汉节　　jousting tournament 马上长矛比武赛　　comedy act 喜剧表演　　balloon 气球　　country pub 乡村酒吧　　cream tea 奶油茶点　　coach 长途客车　　sightseer 观光客，游客　　local 当地居民　　测验与练习　　1. 阅读课文并回答问题。　　1.
