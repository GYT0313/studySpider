　　MBA英语面试中，在自我介绍完了老师就会开始问你问题这里列出一些常见的问题，可以认真准备。注意在准备的过程中，要结合自己的经历和见解来准备答案，让自己回答的问题和整个的自我介绍融为一个整体。要不然很容易被考官抓住把柄，问个没完，很容易因紧张而露出马脚。　　在每一年的面试中都会有很多相同的问题，这些问题看起来很平常，却有很多陷阱，一不小心就会被考官抓主小辫子了。回答这些常见的看起来很平常的问题，是很有艺术的。在这里一共提供了75个常见的各类问题，下面进行详细的分析。　　一、传统面试问题（Sample Traditional Interview Questions）　　1、What can you tell me about yourself？（关于你自己，你能告诉我些什么？）　　这一问题如果面试没有安排自我介绍的时间的话。这是一个必问的问题。考官并不希望你大谈你的个人历史，他是在寻找有关你性格、资历、志向和生活动力的线索，来判断你是否适合读研或者MBA。下面是一个积极正面回答的好例子：“在高中我参加各种竞争性体育活动，并一直努力提高各项运动的成绩。大学期间，我曾在一家服装店打工，我发现我能轻而易举地将东西推销出去。销售固然重要，但对我来说，更重要的是要确信顾客能够满意。不久便有顾客返回那家服装店点名让我为他们服务。我很有竞争意识，力求完美对我很重要。”　　In high school I was involved in competitive sports and I always tried to improve in each sport I participated in。 As a college student， I worked in a clothing store part-time and found that I could sell things easily。 The sale was important， but for me， it was even more important to make sure that the customer was satisfied。 It was not long before customers came back to the store and specifically asked for me to help them。 I‘m very competitive and it means a lot to me to be the best。　　2、 What would you like to be doing five years after graduation？（在毕业以后5年内你想做些什么？）　　你要清楚你实际上能胜任什么。你可以事先和其他的MBA交流一番。问问他们在毕业后在公司的头5年都做了些什么。可以这样回答：“我希望能在我的职位上尽力做好工作，由于在同一领域工作的许多人都被提为区域负责人，所以我亦有此打算。”　　I hope to do my best I can be at my job and because many in this line of work are promoted to area manager， I am planning on that also。　　3。 What is your greatest strength？（你最突出的优点是什么？）　　这是很多面试考官喜欢问的一个问题，这是你“展示自己”的最佳机会，不要吹嘘自己或过于自负，但要让雇主知道你相信自己，你知道自己的优点。如可答：“我认为我最大的优点是能够执着地尽力把事情办好。当做完一件工作而其成果又正合我的预想时，我会有一种真正的成就感。我给自己定了一些高目标。比如说，我要成为出色的毕业生。尽管在大学一年级时我启动慢了些，但最终我以优等论文完成了学业。”　　I feel that my strongest asset is my ability to stick to things to get them done。 I feel a real sense of accomplishment when I finish a job and it turns out just as I‘d planned。 I’ve set some high goals for myself。 For example， I want to graduate with highest distinction。 And even though I had a slow start in my freshman year， I made up for it by doing an honor‘s thesis。　　4。 What is your greatest weakness？（你最大的弱点是什么？）　　你不应该说你没有任何弱点，以此来回避这个问题。每个人都有弱点，最佳策略是承认你的弱点，但同时表明你在予以改进，并有克服弱点的计划。可能的话，你可说出一项可能会给公司带来好处的弱点，如可说：“我是一个完美主义者。工作做得不漂亮，我是不会撒手的。”　　I‘m such a perfectionist that I will not stop until a job is well done。　　5。 How do you feel about your progress to date？“（对于你至今所取得的进步你是怎样看的？）　　绝不要对你以前的所作所为表示内疚。如可答：“我认为我在学校表现不错。事实上，有好几门功课我的成绩居全班第一。在某公司实习时，我获得了该公司数年来给予其雇员的好几项最高评价。”　　I think I did well in school。 In fact， in a number of courses I received the highest exam scores in the class。 As an intern for the X Company， I received some of the highest evaluations that had been given in years。　　二、其他常见问题　　6.Why did you choose peking university？　　7.Why did you choose MBA？　　8.What would you like to be doing five years after graduation？　　9.What has been your greatest accomplishment？
